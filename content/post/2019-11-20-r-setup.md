Please download R and RStudio in preparation for the statistical lab assignments this week.

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/): download the [CRAN mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) closest to your geographic location.
    
* [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download): integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
    
To familiarize yourself with R, you may want to go through some initial sections of [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/), which provide very helpful tutorials.
