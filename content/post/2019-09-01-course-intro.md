Welcome to AP Statistics

Please complete the following items prior to the second day of class:

1. Follow the [College Board instructions](https://collegeboard.org/joinapclass) to join the AP class section for AP Statistics. You will receive the join code on the first day of class. 

2. Read through the [course syllabus](/syllabus/).

3. Check the [course schedule](/schedule/) and complete any remaining items listed under the first day (Sept. 2). 

  * You should check the schedule regularly for homework and classwork assignments.
  * If I make any changes to the schedules, I will generally make announcements in class and add the changes to the online schedules in a different color.
  * Unless otherwise stated, all homework assignments are due the following school day.
