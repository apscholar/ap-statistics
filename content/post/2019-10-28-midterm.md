The midterm has two parts:

1) Part A: 30 multiple-choice questions (60 minutes)

  * Please use a pencil to bubble in answers on your scantron.
    
2) Part B: 2 free-response questions (30 minutes)

  * Please use a pen or pencil to fill out answers on your free-response sheet.
    
The midterm will cover Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in the textbook. The following are the recommended practice problems to prepare for the midterm.


| Chapter   | Textbook Questions | Barron's Questions   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| 1 | p. 78 (T1.1 - 15)    | p. 77 (#1 - 34) <br> p. 144 (# 1 - 12)  | 
| 2 | p. 137 (T2.1 - 2.13) | p. 251 (#1 - 17)        |    
| 4 | p. 279 (T4.1 - 4.14) | p. 159 (#1 - 15) <br> p. 177 (# 1 - 19) |
| 5 | p. 342 (T5.1 - 5.14) | p. 205 (#1 - 46)      |
| 6 | p. 418 (T6.1-6.14)   | p. 234 (#1 - 6)       |



The midterm will include but may not necessarily be limited to the following topics delineated by chapter.

* Chapter 1 topics:
  - 5-number summary
  - boxplots
  - ordering of mean, median, and mode in skewed distributions
  
  
* Chapter 2 topics:
    - z-scores
    - percentiles
    - probability calculations using normal CDF
    
    
* Chapter 4 topics:
  - random sampling methods (SRS, stratified, cluster, systematic)
  - other sampling methods (convenience, voluntary)
  - undercoverage
  - experimental design
      + completely randomized design
      + randomized block design
  - random sampling vs. random assignment
  - causality vs. generalizability
  
  
* Chapter 5 topics:
  - Law of Large Numbers
  - probability
      + General Addition Rule: $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$
      + General Multiplication Rule: $P(A\cap B) = P(A)*P(B|A)$
      + Mutually exclusive vs. independent events
      + Conditional probability
          * $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)}$
  - perfect independence in two-way tables
  
  
* Chapter 6 topics:
  - random variables
  - transformation of random variables
  - binomial distribution
  - geometric distribution
